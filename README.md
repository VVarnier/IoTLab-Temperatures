## Overview

This application displays the various measures retrieved by the
closest sensor.

In order to retrieve the values, the app is querying the IoTLab, which is a
deployed web platform, acting as a broker for the various sensors.

> ðŸ“‘ Note: The IoTLab is deployed within
> [TELECOM Nancy](https://telecomnancy.univ-lorraine.fr/), and can't be reached
> without the university's VPN

## Features

- âœ… The application is [made in C++/CX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cppcx/visual-c-language-reference-c-cx?view=msvc-160), targeting the Windows Phones
- âœ… The user can either track his position using his GPS or fill the field by
  himself
- âœ… The user's coordinates are validated, and the distance between them
  computed using the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)
- âœ… The app is multi-threaded (UI, HTTP calls and guidance)
- âœ… Each of the mote's data are displayed (name, common name, measures)
- âœ… The icons are dynamically chosen: depending of the measure, the icon will
  be different (e.g. a discharge battery will be shown if the mote is running
  out of battery):

- âœ… Support the dark and the light theme:

- âœ… When displaying a mote, the application also provides a compass to indicate
  its position and its distance relatively to the user, as shown in the
  following gif:

- âœ… When clicking on the direction icon, it will open the BingMaps app to guide
  the user toward the mote:
